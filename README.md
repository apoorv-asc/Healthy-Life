# About The Project

## Care.Connect Dashboard

Medical services can be complex without a guide. In a quickly evolving healthcare landscape, positive patient outcomes are becoming the driving focus of every interaction with the healthcare system. That's where value-based care comes in. The goal of value-based care transformation is to enable the healthcare system to create more value for patients. However, there are not many healthcare systems available that aim at solving this problem

Our solution aims at providing a wide variety of tools to assist people of all age group and hence providing them with a better experience. Our solution includes the following:

* AI Health Check-up to ensure early Pre-Medical diagnosis of a wide variety of diseases.
* Shared decision making model to ensure more people are involved than they currently in making decisions about the patient’s health care.
* Analysis of daily activity tracking using FITBIT data for patient monitoring
* Physiotherapy assistant to not only monitor patients progress but also to help them.
* Value Cost Analysis
  >> Inpatient Cost Analysis to give an approximate idea of total expenditure on patient’s treatment.
  >> Treatment Cost Analysis Section to bring pricing transparency and give expenditure analysis on various treatments
  >> Out Patient Cost Analysis Section to give a rough idea about expenditure on outpatient care plans available in various hospitals

* We even extract useful information from chats to enhance user experience by giving timely reminders and other facilities that no other available tools give.
* Risk Scores like Heart Score, CHA2DS2_VASc Score and Framingham Score to help user determine their health condition
